# Core Context - Programs - CodePath.org

At CodePath.org we want to work with university students all across the United States to take them every step of the way through a highly accelerated fast track into the technology industry. Along the way, we will:

  - Inspire and educate students about the tech industry landscape
  - Provide students necessary context and foundations of a career in software engineering
  - Give students a chance for hands-on learning through application development
  - Connect students directly to relatable mentors that support them over time
  - Get students into their first technical internship while in school
  - Get students their first full-time software engineer job
  - Instill a core value of developing mastery and leadership through acts of service

The rest of this guide details the mission and programs that encompass that work.

## Core Mission

We want to offer students a robust and well-rounded undergraduate experience that provides them an accelerated pathway towards 1) building their resume / LinkedIn, 2) starting the internship search early, 3) being fully prepared and confident for technical interviews at top companies, 4) and being high-performing and confident software engineers on the job. 

In short, we want to provide university students the **clearest and most efficient pathway towards a successful and fulfilling career in the tech industry**, free of charge and available to them directly on their campuses. _This starts Freshman year, through their very first internship, all the way to working in their first job in the tech industry after graduating, and beyond._ 

Moreover, we want to provide this to as many students as possible, with a **strong emphasis on those that are the most underserved today**: Black, Latinx, low-income, Appalachian, and other students that don't already have a clear path. **These are students that largely will never be able to pay for courses, so our programs will need to be funded for by companies and universities.**

## Core Programs Overview

There are four different major categories of our university programs:

 1. **Inspire Series** - These are entry-level courses for Freshman and Sophomore in STEM that provide an introductory foundation to product and coding that should be accessible to anyone but targeted to those who have encountered programming before in one way or another.
 2. **Software Fundamentals** - This is a three-part series focused on providing an in-depth foundation to make sure students are prepared for the rigorous technical interviews associated with top tech companies including data structures, algorithms, problem solving and behavioral interview segments. We provide a three-part series to provide students confidence and readiness for even the toughest interviews.
 3. **Special Topics** - Empowering students with the skills and confidence to be high-performing software engineers contributing meaningfully to real-world projects after they join a company. This focuses on specific technical areas such as mobile development, cybersecurity, etc.
 4. **Career Center** - Working directly with students to secure internships and full-time roles by providing resume review feedback and guides, clear instructions on how to apply for technical internships, virtual career fairs, and other events dedicated to helping them find opportunities.

## Why the tech industry?

_Why introduce students to the tech industry in the first place?_ There are many reasons, here are a few:

 - Computer science education in the US is failing many, many students with the current approach. **The software industry is not one-size-fits all and the programs can't be either**. Underrepresented groups drop out of CS at nearly an 80% rate before graduation day. Many of them lose confidence in their abilities and do not end up finding a pathway into tech.
 - The tech industry is a **clear pathway to economic opportunity and empowerment**. No other industry provides such a concrete and attainable path to financial security. This path is open to anyone, regardless of background who is given the proper pathway and support.
 - The tech industry is "eating the world". Entertainment / media, finance, law, business, and more are all built upon lots and lots of software. All of these industries and more will be improved as more and more software engineers are available to empower people to be more effective with their time.
 - The tech industry is what we know, all of us on the team found ourselves in this industry, in one way or another,  and we have an ethical responsibility to reach a hand back towards the next generation.
 - The tech industry is about a lot more than just "coding". Let's not forget that successful software products and business require far more than code. There's room for everyone of all interests: Marketing / PR, Sales, Design, Product, Support, Automated testing, legal, and much more.
