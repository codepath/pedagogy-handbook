# Curriculum Development

### Content Structure and Platform

All of our curriculum and related content is hosted and managed in a structure that is very familiar to how you build out software. In particular, the curriculum and almost all of our technical content:

* Source lives in Github repositories filled with folders and files that comprise the course
* Works like any code repo with issues, pull requests, and commit history
* Content is developed using an enhanced [markdown formatting language](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
* Easily re-use snippets of content to avoid content duplication
* Code syntax highlighting, expandable text blocks, alert boxes, and many other features
* Full support for fully dynamic logic and conditionals and code snippets within the course content
* Full support for multiple course variations \(with the same content being packaged in different ways\)
* Special dynamic tag system enables dynamic insertion of data, dates, information seamlessly drawing from the cohort, location, user, and other details of the person viewing the course.
* Support for custom downloadable files which can be easily hosted and linked to
* Support for markdown-powered slide presentations using reveal.js

#### **Course Content Deployment**

* Curriculum developed using our platform can easily be linked into running classes powered by our linked technical course portal which is powered by these curriculum source packages.
* An automated release process ensures that content updates are pushed to the source repository, the content becomes reflected automatically on the course portal to students \(when pushed to the master branch\)
* Courses can be managed entirely from our organizer dashboard for your organization \(or through CodePath.org\)  
* Course participants can single-sign-on via Github and access any courses they are enrolled into

#### Additional Curriculum Assets

In addition, often the markdown course content will link to content on the following third-party services:

* Speakerdeck/Google Slides - Slide decks
* Youtube - Video content playlists
* HackerRank - Coding assessments or quizzes
