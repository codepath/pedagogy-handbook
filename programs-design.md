# Program Design

## Course Overview

### Structure

A CodePath.org course is as much about the structure as about the curriculum. This means that CodePath.org courses generally have the following components:

* Weekly in-person \(or Zoom remote\) sessions with students at a university
* Semester-long courses with structured curriculums
* Blended learning experience with online resources powered by our learning platform, guides and tools
* Run by professors or TAs \(on-campus\) or professional engineers \(remote\) we've coordinated with and trained earlier
* Typically has required weekly deliverables: projects / exercises that inforce and assess key concepts
* Group-projects and/or collaborative deliverables: specific deliverables that are built together as part of a small team

### Curriculum

Generally speaking our courses have the following content:

* Topic sessions where facilitator introduces the topics for that week as well as discussion or activities surrounding that topic
* Lab sessions where facilitator has students work through a specific set of tasks or exercises
* Assigned deliverables such as projects or exercises each week that must be completed and submitted
* Technical guides, sample code, slides developed and/or accessible to students when they need them most
* Topic or walkthrough videos that provide accessible introductions to key topics introduced for that unit \(week\)
* Assessments \(graded projects or tests\) to assess student's proficiency through the course
* Group projects and activities that provide students an opportunity to collaborate on work as part of a small team

### Modalities

These courses are offered across two modalities:

* **Zoom Remote Course** - Entry-level and Summer courses are offered via Zoom Video Classroom. Students meet once or twice a week with expert instructors, industry mentors, and student leaders to get topic lectures, and lots of hands-on small group activities in break-out rooms.
* **In-Person Facilitated Course** - On-campus, often for-credit courses, in which students meet on their own campus across the United States with CodePath-trained student leaders or professors facilitating the sessions once or twice a week. 

Both of these modalities are **modern blended learning** with a robust course platform that assigns labs and projects, provides video and written resources, and guides student learning throughout the entire experience.

## Program and Platform

All of our programs are powered by a combination of people, process and platform. Our platform is a custom-built suite of tools used by our team, student leaders, mentors, instructors ansd students alike at-scale across all of our deployed cohorts including:

* Online course platform for blended courses combining live and online components
* Admissions system for tracking applicants and managing the admission process
* Curriculum collaboration for technical content with easy branching and tracking
* Documentation of technical topics which is well-structured and searchable
* Searchable question and answer system for technical issues during the course
* Grading and scoring submissions from participants during the course
* Managing configuring, operating, and analyzing running courses
