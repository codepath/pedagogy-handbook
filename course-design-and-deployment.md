# Course Design and Deployment

For any given program we run, there are a number of steps involved to successful design, implementation, and deployment to students:

1. [Creation of Curriculum](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/SkKa6anh7?type=view#1-Creation-of-Curriculum)
2. [Cohort Staffing](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/SkKa6anh7?type=view#2-Cohort-Staffing-Instructor-TechFellow-andor-Volunteer) \(Instructor, TechFellow and/or Volunteer\)
3. [Course Deployment](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/SkKa6anh7?type=view#3-Course-Deployment-Marketing-Admissions-Operations) \(Marketing, Admissions, Operations\)
4. [Course Maintenance and Iteration](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/SkKa6anh7?type=view#4-Course-Maintenance-and-Iteration)

Below we will dive into the different phases involved.

### 1. Creation of Curriculum <a id="1-Creation-of-Curriculum"></a>

Creation of curriculum involves the following high-level areas:

* A. **Staffing** - Hiring contractors for the various key roles during development
* B. **Outlining** - Outlining the course structure unit-by-unit
* C. **Deliverable Design** - Designing the projects, labs and group activities students will be submitting
* D. **Session Design** - Designing the session-by-session plan including exercises and which sessions to introduce which deliverables

#### A. Curriculum Staffing <a id="A-Curriculum-Staffing"></a>

In regards to staffing, we need to contract with people for the following roles during the creation:

1. Contracting multiple domain experts to lead curriculum efforts
2. Contracting supporting content developers from top university students
3. Contracting beta testers for the content from top university students

There are generally between 5 and 10 people involved in the development of a new course:

* Primary curriculum developers \(1-3 people\): Includes designing projects, labs, tests, challenge questions, outlining technical guides
* Supporting curriculum developers \(1-3 people\): Includes supporting technical writing, HackerRank tests, materials, etc.
* Video walkthrough developer \(1-2 people\): Planning and recording video walkthroughs for projects
* Beta testers \(2-3 people\): Running through exercises, labs, and projects and providing detailed feedback to curriculum developers

#### Curriculum Development Process <a id="Curriculum-Development-Process"></a>

Curriculum development for CodePath classes follows this general structure:

1. Staff professional domain experts for the course
2. Identify course development unit outline
3. Create detailed topic, project and lecture outlines
4. Create course skeleton on our learning portal
5. Design pre-work and project assignments with supporting materials
6. Develop lab exercises to be run by students for an hour each week
7. Identify topic guides that need to be written
8. Create slides for lectures to reinforce concepts
9. Fill out course structure into the learning portal

See [our high-level guide to curriculum development for more details](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/class_organizer_training/curriculum_development).

### 2. Cohort Staffing \(Instructor, TechFellow and/or Volunteer\) <a id="2-Cohort-Staffing-Instructor-TechFellow-andor-Volunteer"></a>

Each run of the course requires one or more of the following, depending on the course:

* A. **Instructor** - Includes adapting lecture assets, running sessions or recording videos.
* B. **TechFellow Session Leaders** - These are the student leaders running the course at each campus
* C. **Student Support** - These are the students and others that provide technical support to participants as they run into issues
* D. **Industry Mentors** - These are professional engineers that help out during labs and provide support to students

For the TechFellows, this involves an expansive marketing campaign to students, along with a fellows admission program.

### 3. Course Deployment \(Marketing, Admissions, Operations\) <a id="3-Course-Deployment-Marketing-Admissions-Operations"></a>

Each run of the course requires:

* A. **Marketing** - Expansive outreach to students across existing campuses \(and more for remote classes\)
* B. **Admissions** - Review and admit students into the courses based on application and pre-work
* C. **Coordination** - Work specifically coordinating with people at each campus
* D. **Operations** - Massive operational and logistical efforts to make sure the deployments are successful

#### A. Marketing <a id="A-Marketing"></a>

Marketing includes activities such as:

* Setting up the course landing pages
* Reaching out to students to sign up and enroll in classes
* Reaching out to student clubs and orgs to expand our marketing reach
* Reaching out to professors and students to help us deploy on new universities

#### B. Admissions <a id="B-Admissions"></a>

Marketing includes activities such as:

* Setting up the cohort applications so students can sign up
* Configuring messaging templates for students across the admissions process
* Reviewing applications and pre-works and admitting students based on eligibility criteria \(varies by class\)
* Sending acceptance and starting details to admitted students so they know how to participate

#### C. Coordination <a id="C-Coordination"></a>

Coordination includes activities such as:

* Working to roll out and deploy our programs across our target universities
* Chatting with and coordinating with professors and students to deploy onto new campuses
* Chat and coordinate with existing campuses to make sure new courses are setup
* Coordinate with TPMs to make sure the logistics are taken care of for all locations

#### D. Operations <a id="D-Operations"></a>

Operations includes activities such as:

* Scoring and grading student submissions and deliverables throughout the course
* Messaging students that are at-risk as they miss sessions and deliverables
* Tracking each cohort with a detailed analytics spreadsheet and sending report summary emails

For remote courses with sessions via Zoom:

* Messaging students reminders about each session
* Tracking attendance for each session
* Managing breakout rooms and coordinating with instructor during the session
* Recording and uploading each session to Youtube

### 4. Course Maintenance and Iteration <a id="4-Course-Maintenance-and-Iteration"></a>

During and after each run of the course, the following needs to happen:

* A. **Gather** course feedback across multiple channels
* B. **Analyze** feedback thoughtfully and propose improvements
* C. **Improve** on course structure, policies and curriculum

#### A. Gather course feedback across multiple channels <a id="A-Gather-course-feedback-across-multiple-channels"></a>

We should aggregate five sources of data to best understand how to improve our courses:

* TPM reported issues \(Emailed or call\)
* Student reported issues \(Emailed or call\)
* Withdrawal Notes \(What are the reasons given on the withdrawal form\)
* Mid-point and final surveys \(What are the reasons given in feedback surveys\)
* Submission funnel \(Where did the submissions from students drop off most and why\)

#### B. Analyze feedback thoughtfully and propose improvements <a id="B-Analyze-feedback-thoughtfully-and-propose-improvements"></a>

We then need to look at this aggregated data for patterns and commonalities to understand how to impactfully improve our courses. Notably:

* _How do we build better social capital with students?_ How can we improve our communication of our core values, our mission, and find ways to scalably communicate to students with a focus on inspiration and motivations for sticking through our courses, even when they get difficult.
* _How do we improve eligibility requirements?_ No course works for everyone, how do we either improve the requirements to enroll, or adapt the course to better serve all students admitted.
* _How do improve pacing?_ Do our courses require too much time from students in a given week? How can we tweak the curriculum to find the right pacing for students.
* _How do we improve sessions?_ How can we make sessions a better experience for students. Do we need to improve TechFellow training? Do we need to adjust the session schedule, or re-tune some of the content within the sessions \(i.e labs, etc\)? Do we need better slides given to TechFellows?
* _How do we improve curriculum?_ How can we make the curriculum more resilient and self-contained. Do we need updated/better video walkthroughs for projects? Do we need additional videos recorded to reduce confusion?

Once we identify the specific points of action of what to improve based on feedback, we need to identify a staffing plan for making these improvements happen.

#### C. Improve on course structure, policies and curriculum <a id="C-Improve-on-course-structure-policies-and-curriculum"></a>

Based on analyzing and answering the questions above, we then need to:

* Put together a scope of work for the curriculum iteration
* Contract with domain experts or others to improve the course
* Track the progress until a reasonable iteration of the materials has been achieved
* As needed, coordinate with beta testers to audit any substantially new content

Now the course is ready for the next run! Rinse and repeat.
