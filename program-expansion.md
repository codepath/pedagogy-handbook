# Program Expansion

## Program Expansion

Our programs can and should expand over time in the following ways but balanced with maintaining quality and outcomes:

* **Number of Students at a Campus** - Reaching a larger number of students on a campus within a semester. Across the pipline: Higher number of applied, higher number admitted, higher number completing.
* **Number of Campuses Served** - Reaching a larger number of campuses and locations within a semester. Across the pipline: Higher number of total campuses, 
* **Types of Campuses Served** - In addition to raw number of campuses, we are dedicated to focusing our efforts on "underserved" campuses and students most in need. This includes expanding our program offerings specifically at state universities, HBCUs, colleges in the Appalachians, and community colleges.
* **Number of Courses Offered** - Offering a larger number of our existing courses on each campus (or remotely) within a given semester. 
* **Types of Courses Offered** - Offering a larger array of different courses over time including new Special topics across our locations.
* **MÃ©lange of Staffing Roles** - As enrollment increases, we are dedicated in onboarding quality Technical Mentors, Student Support, TechFellows, and Teaching Assistants.

Note that expansion is important but as noted, should not come at the cost of sacrificing our program quality and outcomes. We need to find the right balance.
