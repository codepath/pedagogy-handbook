# Course Design Lifecycle

For any given program we run, there are a number of steps involved to successful design, implementation, and deployment to students:

1. [Creation of Curriculum](course-stages-creation-of-curriculum.md)
2. [Cohort Staffing](course-stages-cohort-staffing.md) \(Instructor, TechFellow and/or Volunteer\)
3. [Course Deployment](course-stages-course-deployment.md) \(Marketing, Admissions, Operations\)
4. [Course Maintenance and Iteration](course-stages-course-sprints-and-upgrades.md)

Below you can dive into the different phases involved in this process.
