# 1. Creation of Curriculum

Creation of curriculum involves the following high-level areas:

* A. **Staffing** - Hiring contractors for the various key roles during development
* B. **Outlining** - Outlining the course structure unit-by-unit
* C. **Deliverable Design** - Designing the projects, labs and group activities students will be submitting
* D. **Session Design** - Designing the session-by-session plan including exercises and which sessions to introduce which deliverables

#### A. Curriculum Staffing <a href="a-curriculum-staffing" id="a-curriculum-staffing"></a>

In regards to staffing, we need to contract with people for the following roles during the creation:

1. Contracting multiple domain experts to lead curriculum efforts
2. Contracting supporting content developers from top university students
3. Contracting beta testers for the content from top university students

There are generally between 5 and 10 people involved in the development of a new course:

* Primary curriculum developers (1-3 people): Includes designing projects, labs, tests, challenge questions, outlining technical guides
* Supporting curriculum developers (1-3 people): Includes supporting technical writing, HackerRank tests, materials, etc.
* Video walkthrough developer (1-2 people): Planning and recording video walkthroughs for projects
* Beta testers (2-3 people): Running through exercises, labs, and projects and providing detailed feedback to curriculum developers

#### Curriculum Development Process <a href="curriculum-development-process" id="curriculum-development-process"></a>

Curriculum development for CodePath classes follows this general structure:

1. Staff professional domain experts for the course
2. Identify course development unit outline
3. Create detailed topic, project and lecture outlines
4. Create course skeleton on our learning portal
5. Design pre-work and project assignments with supporting materials
6. Develop lab exercises to be run by students for an hour each week
7. Identify topic guides that need to be written
8. Create slides for lectures to reinforce concepts
9. Fill out course structure into the learning portal
