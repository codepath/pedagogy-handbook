# 2. Cohort Staffing

### Cohort Staffing \(Instructor, TechFellow and/or Volunteer\) <a id="2-Cohort-Staffing-Instructor-TechFellow-andor-Volunteer"></a>

Each run of the course requires one or more of the following, depending on the course:

* A. **Instructor** - Includes adapting lecture assets, running sessions or recording videos.
* B. **TechFellow Session Leaders** - These are the student leaders running the course at each campus
* C. **Student Support** - These are the students and others that provide technical support to participants as they run into issues
* D. **Industry Mentors** - These are professional engineers that help out during labs and provide support to students
* E. **Teaching Assistant** - These are Codepath alumni that reinforce lessons taught by Instructor by tutoring and mentoring individual students or small groups.

For the TechFellows, this involves an expansive marketing campaign to students, along with a fellows admission program.
