# Course Design Lifecycle

For any given program we run, there are a number of steps involved to successful design, implementation, and deployment to students:

1. [Creation of Curriculum](./#1-Creation-of-Curriculum)
2. [Cohort Staffing](./#2-Cohort-Staffing-Instructor-TechFellow-andor-Volunteer) \(Instructor, TechFellow and/or Volunteer\)
3. [Course Deployment](./#3-Course-Deployment-Marketing-Admissions-Operations) \(Marketing, Admissions, Operations\)
4. [Course Maintenance and Iteration](./#4-Course-Maintenance-and-Iteration)

Below we will dive into the different phases involved.
